Lemon is a one weight, 12 width headline typeface. Its many stylistic alternates allow for playful settings and super-compact title arrangements. Its initial skeleton was inspired by heavy grotesk typefaces from the ’60s and ’70s, which we worked to compress and stretch out into extreme widths. As a special addition to the font, we implemented features that allow you to arrange and modify the position of characters. You can make them jump over the baseline or hang from the top.
