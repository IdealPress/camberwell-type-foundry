My font is based around the Royal Festival Hall. I was really inspired by the mid-century design of the building, more specifically the carpet used throughout; it's meant to represent the visualisation of sound from an oscilloscope machine. In my own font, I looked at different visualisations of sound and decided to look at morse code. To convey this I broke up the stems of the letters depending on the dots used in the morse code alphabet, also to deeper reflect on the building I made the forms quite square with rounded edges to connote the mid-century design of the building.
