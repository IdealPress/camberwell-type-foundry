Bonnington Arcus explores the close-knit community of Bonnington Square in Vauxhall. Since the revival of the square in the 80’s by squatters, residents have come together to create a beautiful and serene atmosphere. This is seen through the building of the public garden and café where residents used to cook for one another. To represent this in a type format, I used the shape of the arches above doors and windows as a repeated motif found on all of the houses in Bonnington, and used the shape of the bricks at the end of the arches as serif details.
