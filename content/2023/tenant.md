'Tenant' combines modernist principles with contemporary influences, aiming to replicate the essence of 1950s prefabricated homes. The goal was to create a typeface that is functional and uniform, whilst still containing unique elements that represent the community of Excalibur Estate. It includes visual components gathered from the structure itself, but essentially aims to convey the structural concept of the building. Simple, blunt, and unembellished, 'Tenant' was produced to promote this relic of a post-war decade, a symbol of a close-knit community. The typeface carries the name of the entity that allowed these structures to outlive their initial purpose and the government's expectations: the people that made Excalibur their home.
