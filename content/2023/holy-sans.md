Inspired by the structural characteristics of Gothic Revival architecture – such as spires, columns and arches – Holy Sans breaks the norms of basic proportions that make up typefaces by being novel in its shape. Through its iterative and unified structure across the letters, the typeface explores the boundary between the utilitarian and expressive aspects of modern typefaces.
