My typeface is called 105 Letters. It is based on a prisoner from Brixton prison called Bertrand Russell. Bertrand Russell was a British philosopher, mathematician and social activist. Russell became one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. He was best known to the general public as a peace activist and a popular author on social, political, and ethical topics. Russell went to Brixton prison for six months due to his subversive anti-war activism, which he completed after the war. Russell participated in the anti-nuclear weapons demonstrations in 1961 and was jailed for encouraging others to break the peace. My font is based on the letters Bertrant Russell wrote during his incarceration; he wrote a total of 105 letters. These letters were released 100 years from when they were written, my type is a reflection of this. I studied and practised his handwriting to visually create what it would look like 100 years later.
