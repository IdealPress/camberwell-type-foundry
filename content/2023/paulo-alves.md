The Prime Meridian line made the voyages of Sailors much easier and allowed for efficient journeys, I will translate this efficiency and convenience in my typeface by making it bold with a thick weight to ensure readability from afar, I will not use serifs on my typeface as that will make it less legible and it simply adds no functional purpose to the typeface only illustrative stylisation. The decision to remove the serifs came from my modular type work I did which I then compared to the previous A-Z I created and realised it is more readable not only because of the removal of serifs but has more consistency throughout the strokes as well as obviously correlating to what the Observatory is most famous for, i.e. simplifying something which was complicated. Making my my typeface bold was an idea that came to me upon my first glance at the Greenwich Observatory building and I instantly thought of the phrase, “sticks out like a sore thumb”, which refers to how it not a building you’d miss if walking past, in fact, loads of tourists, historians, architects and artists have visited the building’s location to photograph it and study it just as I have.
