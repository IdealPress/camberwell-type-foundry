My typeface is called Barbra 50. It is influenced heavily by the Barbican building, especially by the architecture and its features that make it stand out. My font is futuristic, geometrical and modernist. The unique angles in the shoulders and arms within the typeface are oval with sharp edges, within the font an elongated oval shape can be seen that appears in the barbicans windows and the letters themselves fit into a rectangle. The letters sit flat on the baseline and the arm and shoulders of the letters are flat against the x-height.
