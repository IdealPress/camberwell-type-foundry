Backstage is based on the Brutalist-styled National Theatre. The heavy, rectangular font is inspired by the Theater’s concrete facade. The contrasting line weight is based on the contrast between the concrete blocks and metal railings. It also references the scaffolding frames that are used when building stage sets in the National Theatre’s Max Rayne Centre.
