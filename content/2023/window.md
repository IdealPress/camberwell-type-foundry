South London gallery is the place where I got the inspiration of this typeface. This gallery has many artworks inside and they have different topics. I wish to use “window” this object to attract people attention. The exhibits couldn’t be seen outside the building. While through the window, passenger could dimly see the exhibits inside the gallery. The passenger could know a little bit content of the work also make they feel curious what the whole gallery look like. The window of the gallery is neoclassical style. I choose two type looking to be my inspiration, one look like arch another look like crystal column.
