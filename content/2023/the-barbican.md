The Barbican font stands on an angular foundation, very much replicating the architecture of the Barbican estate. Captured is the contrast and juxtaposition of such hard, raw materials being used to build the most incredible curves and angular edges. The font utilizes recurring shapes at the Barbican estate: arched windows, parallel structures, and dominating skylines.
