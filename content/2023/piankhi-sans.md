Piankhi sans is a bold and modern sans-serif font that is inspired by the construction and architecture of the black and minority owned self-build houses of Nubia Way in Lewisham. The name “Piankhi” is derived from the traditional spelling of black Nubian Pharaoh “Piye”. The uppercase in Piankhi sans is constructed following the same grid that ordinary, working-class people of colour followed to construct their own houses in the early 90’s when Nubia Way was built. The lowercase is entirely unique to the uppercase and in itself. The letterforms are full of personality and individuality, as well as being inspired by Afro culture and history. This contrast between strict letterforms and entire individuality means that Piankhi sans can be used in a wide variety of contexts, as a captivating and playful font that defines what it means to be proud of our individuality and our achievements.
