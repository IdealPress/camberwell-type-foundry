Time piece is a serif based typeface I designed based on the architecture of the Greenwich Observatory and more specifically, the many clockfaces found within. The design’s focal point is the clock hand motif; it’s hand drawn, ornate style reflects the uniqueness of every clock hand I took inspiration from as well as creates a unique set of expressive letters that reflect the observatory’s exhibited objects. The typeface’s intended usage is for signage, titles and large prints due to the high level of detail and the more intricate shapes used to create some of the letterforms.
