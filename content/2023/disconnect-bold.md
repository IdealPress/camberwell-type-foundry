This font is designed based on the cracked elements inside and outside the building, which explains the scene of war very well. The letters 'W', 'U' and 'V' were partly inspired by the tanks that lined the front of the Imperial War Museum building. Some of the outline features of the letters also partly refer to the architectural appearance of the museum, the top dome of the museum. This typeface features a bold body with a heavyweight. The most obvious feature is that they are all composed of disconnected parts, symbolizing that war separates everyone and loss of contact.
