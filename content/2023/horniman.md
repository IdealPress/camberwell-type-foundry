Horniman is based upon a ‘H’ I photographed cast on a wall in the Horniman museum, that expresses the nature inspired collections within. It consists of wobbly crossbars, and slightly unbalanced, handwritten letterforms. It’s construction with contrasting bubbled serifs and large counters represents the vast unusual and unique collections that the museum houses. The style can be seen as similar to an old-style children’s book typeface, which may symbolise the original educational purposes of the Museum; showcasing the culture and traditions of many oriental regions to the early 20th century London population.
