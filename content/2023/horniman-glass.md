Horniman Glass is based on the concepts that surround a museum rather than the exterior of the building itself. Within the Horniman museum, located in Dulwich, are a remarkable multitude of historical intrigues, cultural commodities and biological preservations. Most items of interest were, as is commonplace, protected by glass display cases. Locked away from curious hands but free to be seen by anybody who enters the museum. Thus, I decided to include the nature of these display cases in my type by making the border three dimensional and mimicking the sharp edges of a glass box.
As observed the various rooms and halls of the building, I noticed that between the natural objects and the cultural artefacts there was something tying them together. Shells were extremely common in both halls as not only are there a plethora of visually diverging shells to be found in nature and due to this they are often used as decoration, jewellery and even in some cases used as a material for clothing. Thus, the perfect item to put in my glass box letters is a variety of shells, locked away physically yet plain to see visually, and so Horniman Glass came into being.
