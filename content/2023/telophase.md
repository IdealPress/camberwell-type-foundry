This typeface aims to embody the two-faced state of the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens - which was dangerous and dubious, opposite its glittering facade. Pleasure gardens were the dreamland for the population, advertised to be filled with high culture entertainment and center of the newest artworks. However, the underside that the population could not see was the continuous harassment and drunk-ness. I wanted to represent this dramatic contrast using a thick serif, presenting the gleaming reputation, and using thin strokes that get separated on some parts to present the corrupted reality.
