Pictorial is a direct and creative typeface inspired by the architecture and props in The Cinema Museum. The letters are produced using a San Serif font which follows the form and structure of an old film camera held within the building, seen in the small details submerged in the lettering. I have managed to adhere to the shape of the building by keeping a square-like structure, giving it a uniformed look. The use of the font can be used in any creative way, on a large scale, just like the desired use of the building.
