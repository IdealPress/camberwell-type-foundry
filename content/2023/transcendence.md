Transcendence is a typeface inspired by the Nunhead Cemetery. The focus of this typeface was the abandonment of the cemetery and how foliage has taken over the cemetery after it has been neglected by the government. The typeface has been directly influenced by old Victorian typography, and more precisely, stone carvings. Itâ€™s called transcendence because transcendence is the last stage of a near death experience and it is a mystical state of consciousness, which I thought matches perfectly the experience of visiting cemeteries as that is as close to death as you can get as a living person.
