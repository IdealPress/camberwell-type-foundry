Transit is a sans-serif type with its inspiration taken from the shapes within the architecture of the Stockwell bus garage in London. As well as the red London buses window shapes. The type is very versatile and is meant to be used in a big format, to have a proper view of the details within the letters. But, can also be used on smaller scales if preferred. It is mostly recognized for its squared arches and window-like shapes.
