I used some pictures from my field research to do this work. The first thing is to look at their lines and shapes, and then use your imagination to develop different ideas. The overlay of many pictures is used to make the same architectural stage have different visual effects from different angles.

For example, the shapes of "x" and "s" look particularly distorted. In the picture, they are evolved from pigeons and stairs. I disintegrated their structures by painting, so that I could clearly know which part could be designed into what shape, and then studied how to design them. The same goes for the other letters.
