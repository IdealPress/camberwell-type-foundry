The typeface Exstate is inspired by The Excalibur Estate, a small estate of timeless prefabricated houses which have been standing since the 1940â€™s. These tiny single storey houses were the quickest solution to solve the housing shortage following WW2. Their structure is shown in the letters - the houses are very similar, low in height, have flat roofs and large windows that are placed at the upper corners right next to the roofs. This is shown through the high crossbars, with rectangular counters that are high up to reflect the look of the windows. There are only upper serifs, depicting the flat roofs. Letters are slightly rounded, reflecting the strong bonds of the residents and the warmth of their community - straight lines would make the letters look too blocky and harsh; only the bottoms of the letters are straight as the houses are set in ground. The slight contrast of the strokes also visualises the placement of the windows.
