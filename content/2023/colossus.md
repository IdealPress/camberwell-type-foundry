Colossus is a modular font based on the 1981-built Crystal Palace. This typeface was created using a calligraphy pen since the fountain pen was typically utilised at the time the Crystal Palace was constructed. Despite having a boxy appearance, the letters' corners have a little curvature to mimic the building's dome. Colossus is an organic typeface as each letter was drawn by hand, making each one somewhat original.
