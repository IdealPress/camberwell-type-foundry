The base inspiration for this comes from one of the oldest UK's prisons located in Brixton. I took an experimental approach in creating 'separation', whereby I represented detachment through replicating angles and cuts of a letter on folded paper. From some angles, the glyph would look almost connected, which is representing the prison's location, that being so close to the local community. The typeface represents the disconnection of the parts of the prison, as well as expressing its disassociation from the area it is situated in. The essential form of the glyphs was a bold narrow font to replicate the high wall surrounding the prison.
