Inspired by National Theatre, a "Highly discussed" Architecture, which relate to the 1950s Brutalism Movement, I decided to make a typeface that makes each character looks like a small Brutalism Architecture. Thus, I took the square shape and added rounded corners to show the warmness.

Each character was designed full of details and was used to further art works developments and any creative creations. 

This is a typeface that does not quite for "daily writing", but people can defiantly create possibilities with it. I hope the typeface can bring a spark inside darkness and comfort in dizzy.
