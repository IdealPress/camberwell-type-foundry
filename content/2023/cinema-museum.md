The Cinema Museum has a very good collection of a number of precious cultural relics about cinema, but also carries the unique film culture of that generation. In the design process of building Cinema Museum, I adopted the pixel style design, integrated the Victorian architectural style, and emphasized the structure and corners of the font. At the same time, because my theme is related to cinema, and most of the equipment displayed in museums are film projection equipment, I also integrate the element of film into the font, increasing the retro sense of the font.
