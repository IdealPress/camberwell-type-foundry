The Blueprint Of War is an interpretation of the Imperial War Museumâ€™s layout. An experimental, semi modular, sans serif typeface. Firstly, every letter follows the same rules as every nation must abide to the laws of war (IHL). Secondly, most letters share similar characteristics while others are more unique. The Purpose of this was to convey two opposing factions coming together. However, they are divided by their country and ideals, to which the foundation of war has been built. As the weight of the font is thick its designed to be used in Books, posters and magazines as headings.
