ROG is a typeface that represents different aspects about the Royal Observatory Greenwich; the observatory was used in the advancement of astronomy and developing clocks for keeping time. Visually it can represent the area of a swinging pendulum which where the first clocks to be used, but it also has conceptual aspects alluding to the weight that time has over us and the change from analogue to digital resources. It was inspired by a clock face that is on display in the museum and also from how the building has changed purpose over time.
