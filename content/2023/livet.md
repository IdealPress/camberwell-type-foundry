Livet is a type based on the contrast of Nunhead cemetery. The main building in the cemetery has robust foundation, but the decoration on the building is quite detailed. The cemetery also has a dark and overgrown garden compared to the surrounding area. I have showcased this in my type by making the contrast in the strokes high. The stem is thicker and is sans serif, while the limbs and bowl are thinner and with serifs. Livet is an elegant and playful font that can be used for various purposes, though it will look best in a bigger size.
