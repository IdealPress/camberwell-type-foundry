For my typeface inspired by the National Theatre, I focussed in on the architectural design of the building. I explored with the letterforms found inside the quirks of the theatres exterior. Those specific letterforms were K, E, I and H. From this, sketches were made and I was able to base the other letterforms off the characteristics within the original 4. Using the architecture of the building as a base for my typeface effectively linked the designs back to the original source.
