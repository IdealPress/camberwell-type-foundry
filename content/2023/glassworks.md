Glassworks is a sans-serif outline typeface that was inspired by the glass architecture of The Crystal Palace. The concept behind my design is based on the idea of layering, I focused into the foundations of this buildingâ€™s architecture where I concentrated on the vertical and circular features. I loosely based my design around the modular font technique keeping the same curves and vertical stems within my letters. This typeface is better suited to be used at a larger pt as the layering within my design is lost at a smaller size.
