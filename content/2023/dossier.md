Dossier is a mono-space, mono-width typeface inspired by the MI6 building at Vauxhall Cross. Designed to be reminiscent of typewritten correspondence, the typeface combines the structure of older documents with the modern visuals of sans-serif lettering. Simple and restrained, Dossier works well as a practical workhorse typeface that aims to subtly reference the now disused aesthetics of the Secret Services.
