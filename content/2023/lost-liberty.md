‘Lost Liberty’ is a typeface inspired by HMP Brixton, one of Londons oldest prisons. The typeface aims to raise awareness of the state of U.K prisons and the history of incarceration. Its visual links to prison bars brings attention to whether prison architecture facilitates reform, or whether it only hinders progress. The thick, unbracketed serifs provide another link to prison bars and harsh prison environments. The design of the lettering was inspired by Didot typefaces and a series of lithographs of the prison produced by Henry Mayhew in the late 1800’s.
