My typeface is heavily influenced or inspired by Charlie Chaplin, as you can obviously see from the shapes of the typefaces. The cinema museum is filled with vintage cinema equipments and posters which brings us back to the 1920s when movies are still in black and white and with no sound. However, the cinema museum is Charlie Chaplin's childhood home there the place is filled with Charlie Chaplin's merchandises and statues. Charlie Chaplin has an iconic image of a hat and a little mustache with his stick. Therefore I decided to put those features onto the typefaces to make the letters like Charlie Chaplin. I added Charlie's hat to the letters and also added mustache to the letters, so when you look at them from in front, it's exactly the silhouette of Charlie Chaplin.
