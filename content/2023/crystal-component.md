Crystal Component is a sans serif, modular font that heavily draws from the industrialised and logical system of construction used in the creation of Crystal Palace. The concept behind the design of the font is based on taking inspiration from the architectural details of the building, while not being confined to them. My concept included taking the modules used in the original construction and reimagining them to fit alternative shapes. The main purpose of the typeface is to revive the memory of a no longer existing structure that played a key role in many significant events for Great Britain at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.
