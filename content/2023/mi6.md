The typeface centres around the idea of hiding and camouflaging, demonstrating the life of how the spies of the MI6 live and how they cover themselves from and be one of us, at the same time, finishing their mission. With the least amount of strokes as the hint for the word, it portrays out the shape of the letter. The audience will have to use their own mind to fill out the missing strokes to realise the panorama for the word.
