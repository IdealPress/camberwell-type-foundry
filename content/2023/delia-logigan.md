I have developed my ideas based on shapes found onto the building, and focusing more on the architecture and style of the building rather than the history of it.

The Vauxhall Tavernâ€™s architecture has a classy feel to it, along with the rustic brick walls which are chipped and corroded by nature. The most interesting shapes and patterns which captured my attention were the repetitive windows, with a rounded top and the wooden frames, which looked very symmetrical. The Vauxhall Tavern is a perfect example of how repetition can be used in architecture, and I wanted to implement this idea into my font especially on the uppercase letters whilst keeping the lowercase letters light and delicate.
