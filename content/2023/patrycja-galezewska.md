This typeface was designed to represent the history of the building and its link to the area throughout the years. It doesn’t focus on the building’s architecture but rather its role and existence in society. The combination of matrix and black lettering, representing the old and the new, reflects the various additions or changes made to the building throughout the years and the patchwork of history that that essentially left behind.
