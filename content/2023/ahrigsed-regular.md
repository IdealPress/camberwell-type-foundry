Ahrigsed Regulars is a sans-serif typeface, now available in Regular only. It has a modern and nostalgic feel that corresponds to the style of the present and the 19th century. The design is inspired by Kirkaldy's own experience and the elements of the building that bears his name, as well as personal experience, and uses these elements to give the typeface a more dynamic spirit. The look and feel of the typeface are clean and distinctive. It is also easy to read and fun to use in short texts.
