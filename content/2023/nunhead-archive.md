The intentions for my font are based on the construction of each letter relating to the archaism of the cemetery itself. Each grave represents one person and tells a story not only from the decorative details of the tombstones but the information written on it as well. Due to its age, some of the words are illegible but therefore represents an archive of history, personal to each gravestone. My font explores the importance of the idea of history and ‘archive’ but also the organic nature of time passing.
