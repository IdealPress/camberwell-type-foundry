Jardinier is designed by nature, inspired by Londonâ€™s Walworth Gardens. This small communal garden is a hidden gem contrasted by the concrete jungle that surrounds it. This modern sans serif typeface aims to capture this through a friendly, youthful display, that uses organic letterforms that replicate elements from the natural world. Its plantation style strokes are casual and freeing, giving a charming sense of imperfection in its almost handwritten style.  Its distinctive feature is the the tapering stems that transcend from thick to thin. Jardinier can be utilised in various ways, but is best suited to branding; logos, packaging design, lifestyle products and sustainable design.
