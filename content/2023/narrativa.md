Narrativa is a semi-mono-weight sans serif modular font that captures the history of calligraphy, the gothic architecture of the Garden Museum, and the objects exhibited. It utilizes an angular base but rounded ascenders and descenders, reminiscent of the museumâ€™s flora and tall arches. Unique features include the flicked hooks and tails on certain letters, inspired by the evolution of calligraphy during the 11th century to the present day. This typeface suits film posters, displays, and headings; it is also perfect for branding.
