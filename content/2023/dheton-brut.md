‘Dheton Brut,’ which originates from the term ‘Beton Brut,’ explores the translation into English of ‘raw concrete.’ Dheton Brut illustrates elements of my research that I have discovered regarding the physicality's and structure of 1970’s Brutalist architecture, personal anecdotes from Sarah Macintosh’s (the architect) interview with Simon Phipps. Dawson’s Heights is seen as a pinnacle of council housing and is highly viewed by its tight knit community. It’s obtrusive, overwhelming structure of a Ziggurat temple is supported by the ‘best views’ across London. I have tried to incorporate these aspects in a collaborative approach to my typeface.
