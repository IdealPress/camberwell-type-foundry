This font is based on the decoration in Horniman Museum, inspired by the fact that it served different people at different times -- in the past, it was a relatively serious museum, but today, many families would choose to spend their weekends there. The theme of this font is the changes of the function of a same object in different times. In combination, I added classical decoration on the basic of relatively modern characters to create a simple font that people can use daily in title, game and so on.
