‘Sceaux Block’ is a typeface designed with inspiration from Sceaux Gardens Estate, an apartment complex located in Camberwell. 

The typeface was created by using a ‘Matrix Structure’ grid template, which was designed directly from the architectural layout of one of the building face’s window designs, using the window frame, window pane, and surrounding reinforcement panes. This grid layout creates formulaic, block-like lettering, reflecting the apartment blocks themselves. Also the concept of using the windows reflects the theme of community, as the visual motif of various windows being lit up by different lights and personalities, is reflected by the windows being shaded in to create the letter forms.
