Tollen Fitz-Sans is a modern font inspired by the architectural aesthetic of the Rotherhithe Tunnel. It follows the structure and characteristics of the tunnel, as well as highlighting it’s history of pedestrian use through double line which informally represents the pavements lining the inside of the underpass. The name comes from its designer Maurice Fitzmaurice who was an Irish Engineer leading to ‘Tollen’- the Irish word for Tunnel, and the fact it’s a San serif typeface.
