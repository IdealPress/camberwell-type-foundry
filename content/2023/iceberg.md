My typeface Iceberg was influenced by the MI6 building conceptually and architecturally. I make reference to the similarity of my building to an iceberg which is largely hidden underwater, much like the actual MI6 building, which holds much floor space underground. This also conceptually reflects the lack of information the general public know about the secret intelligence service. Furthermore, I convey this in my typeface through the bold sans-serif letterforms with a heavy bottom to imply much knowledge surrounding MI6 is under wraps. Visually, I have reflected the geometric structure of the building with thin white lines to display the large rectangular glass panels on the building.
