Inspired by the towering social housing estate found in East Dulwich, Contra is a semi-mono weight sans serif typeface that aims to express the post-war brutalist genre of Dawson’s Heights. Following the matrix method, each letter is uniform in length and width as it follows a 3x7 rectangular grid. A distinctive characteristic of the design is the addition of rounded terminals, intended to reflect the contrast of the building’s malleable interior and unchanging exterior. Contra is the perfect typeface for branding, poster design, product packaging or whatever your desire for it may be.
