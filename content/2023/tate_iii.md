Tate III, is a typeface inspired by the Tate Modern. It is a decorative font that would be used best for headings and sub-headings. The font's structured lines are inspired by the building's contemporary architectural style, which uses clean and straight lines. Whereas, the curved lines and loops are inspired by the spiral, concrete staircases can be seen throughout the building. I wanted to include these staircases into my design because even though they're made of concrete, they make they building feel slightly lighter. I aimed to create a typeface that reflected the building structure and design, but also the art inside, which can be surreal and slightly abstract.
