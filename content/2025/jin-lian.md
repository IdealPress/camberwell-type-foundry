My typeface is based on the Peckham site 'Kim Lien Mini Market', a place dedicated to the multiculturalism of Peckham as the people of the area come into this shop to buy their regular bottle of soy sauce, or try a new snack they'd never seen. I wanted to draw on this theme of multiculturalism but also focus on the identity of Vietnamese culture foremost and honour it in. Displayed is a modular font that is made from the diactritics that are present in the Vietnamese language, used to form the Latin alphabet.
