Grafted is a display typeface inspired by the contrast of natural and unnatural elements found in Lucas Gardens, Camberwell. The main focus of this type's design were the manmade measures used to encourage and hinder the growth of plants within the park; resulting in a high contrast typeface that contains bold structural elements alongside organic feeling serifs. A sense of character is observable in the nature of the park as it interacts with its manmade environment. The plants have been metaphorically and sometimes physically grafted to their new habitat, creating natural reactions to unnatural contexts. This typeface attempts to capture this personality by representing each letter as free flowing within the confines of its uniformity.
