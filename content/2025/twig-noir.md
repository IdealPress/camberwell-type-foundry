'Twig Noir' is a typeface that combine the elegant structure of gothic lettering with the living sense of nature. Drawing inspiration from the overgrown stillness of Nunhead Cemetery, the typeface captures the delicate balance between life, death, and the natural decay and cycle of time. Based on a gothic frame, the typeface features branch-like strokes, with shapes that combine sharp angles with softness, mimicking the sharp edges and natural extensions of branches, symbolizing the sense of life in nature. Conveying the duality of life and death and the close relationship between human and nature, 'Twig Noir' is perfect for exploring themes of life, death, and the delicate balance between nature and decay.
