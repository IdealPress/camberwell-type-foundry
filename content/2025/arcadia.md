Inspired by Holdron's Arcade, Arcadia is a display typeface formed from arches and square shapes, reflecting the structural changes the building has undergone over time, transitioning from it's iconic archway, to a square roof which caters to a more industrial aesthetic. Arcadia intends to bridge the past and present, integrating the building with it's history in a typeface designed for use in contemporary contexts, bringing elements of it's past into a more modern space. As Peckham undergoes gentrification& development, Arcadia serves as both a homage to the area's rich history, and a celebration of the creative energy shaping it's transformation.
