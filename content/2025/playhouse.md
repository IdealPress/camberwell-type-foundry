My typeface is based on the Peckham Theatre. Being fully refurbished in 2016, I wanted to portray the playfulness and unique characteristics which could be seen and felt within the site. Using existing shapes that were prevalent in the building exterior and atmosphere, such as the windows and geometric patterns, I aimed to create a design which accentuates the experience of the modern theatre with its focus on the performing arts. Focusing on more wavy and round edges for my typeface, I wanted to balance the fluidity of excitement and dedication that surrounded the theatre as its community was filled with passion and enthusiasm.
