CUTS: Lines, speeches, songs, or any other element in a printed script left out of a particular production.

To create this performance of a font, many interesting ideas were sacrificed but in extange a dynamic sharp sleek design that embodies a home of cultures, perspectives and many voices. A place to experience, The Theatre Peckham.

Its design illustrates the iridescent concave and convex illusions found when looking at the building from certain angles Each letter creates an illusion within itself and when put together a very dynamic font that dances as you type is created. A great show to see
