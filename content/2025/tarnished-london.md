The typeface 'Tarnished London' features many aspects linking back to the K2 model of telephone boxes, which despite being seen as an iconic part of London architecture, are often forgotten, left derelict, and ultimately have tarnished metal features. This design features the roof shape of the K2 telephone box, designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, with a soft dome shape. The sharp angles pay homage to the Gilbert Scott family, as they were all architects within the sharp Gothic style. And finally, it features aspects of the first telephone box, the K1, with the ball shape on top of the roof.
