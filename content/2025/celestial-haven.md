Celestial Haven is a typeface that bridges the gap between dreams and reality, inspired by the ethereal atmosphere of Theatre Peckham. By combining sharp, defined shapes with flowing curves and unfinished lines, it grounds the design in the tangible while invoking an ethereal, dreamlike quality. The typeface celebrates the balance between structure and fluidity, offering a sense of calm and tranquility. Designed to slow the pace of life, it creates a space for relaxation and reflection. The sharp edges symbolize reality, while the soft, incomplete curves invite an otherworldly escape, providing moments of stillness and allowing the mind to
wander.
