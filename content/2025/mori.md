Mori is a typeface heavily influenced by the gothic
architecture of Nunhead Cemetery, the history of its
abandonment and the subsequent encroachment of
nature over the grounds. Mori is made of angular lines
and the condensed, slender letterforms as to embody the
imposing features of the Anglican Chapel, and the serifs
link to 19th Century architecture and type of the period,
which was explored through calligraphy experimentation. 
The dramatic nature of my typeface makes it appropriate 
for multiple contexts.
