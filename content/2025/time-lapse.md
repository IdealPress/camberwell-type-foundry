This typeface explores the historical elements of Denmark Hill Station, capturing its architectural significance over time.

Through my typeface time-lapse, I aim to represent the station's transformation, from its original Victorian design to its reconstruction following the 1980 fire.

By showcasing key historical details, the typeface reflects the changes of time, symbolizing the resilience and continuity of Denmark Hill. The. shifts in letterforms showcases the station's journey, blending the past with the present to create a design that is both historical and modern
