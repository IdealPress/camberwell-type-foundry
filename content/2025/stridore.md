Stridore is a comment on the naturalism of manmade objects and how the world we live in is a result of human manipulation alongside the randomness of the natural world; Walworth Garden itself is the living manifestation of this and so are it's contents; through the art-pieces and objects simply existing within I found inspiration and harnessed it to construct a typeface that is grounded in nature. Stridore is built behind the foundation of hose-pipes and bees, to commemorate the closed apiary in Walworth garden. Celebrating all things natural, Stridore is a type face that can be used by Gardens and everyone who enjoys the wonders of the natural environment around us.
