The creation of this set of fonts is inspired by the natural form of floor tile seams. During the design process, I deeply analysed and discovered the unique characteristics of the seams, such as irregular width variations, ductility, and the bending of the seams with localisation and fracture. The characteristics are cleverly integrated into the structure of the typeface, forming a unique typeface design that not only presents adsorbed width variations and ductility in the form, but also maintains balance and distinction in the structure. Through the combination of these elements, an innovative typeface with both modern aesthetics and natural elements is created, fully reflecting the dynamism and tension in typeface design.
