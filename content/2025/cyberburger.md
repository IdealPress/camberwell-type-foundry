My inspiration comes from Burger King. My font is based 
on the exterior architectural lines of Burger King and the 
fonts used by Burger King throughout its history. Each 
generation of Burger King's fonts has a distinct contrast in 
thickness. On this basis, I made some changes. I wanted it 
to look more futuristic and industrial, 
 so I removed the arcs in the font. The final font presented is
geometric in style and close to a 3D effect visible to the 
naked eye, with obvious variations in thickness. These 
obvious variations in thickness are what I wanted to present as the shadow and also an heritage from the past generation of Burger Kings font
