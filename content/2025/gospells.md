This research delves into the use of a musical notation-themed typeface to capture the unique acoustic ambiance of Rye Lane Chapel. Translating these auditory elements into the visual language of musical notation offers a way to explore and document these environments. While researching classic handwritten music, I was struck by the intricate beauty and detail they often embody. Much like music, typography is a standalone art form. The variation in stroke thickness and the dynamic visual rhythm of the lines each contribute meaningfully, (Much like the chapel's rich details) building upon one another to create a cohesive, purposeful final design.
