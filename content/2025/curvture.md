When I visited the South London Gallery, I was drawn to the gate because of its beautiful ironwork and curves. With every visit, it displayed new details that showed the talent and history behind it. I discovered that the Green Man design on the gate stands for rebirth and change, symbolising the gallery's transformation from a working men's college to a vibrant center for modern art. Curvsive captures the spirit of renewal attached throughout the gate's history as well as its eternal elegance. The letterforms represent both past and modern design, flowing with decoration and staying bold.
