Influenced by Lucas Gardens, this typeface symbolises the effects of neglect and disrespect on public areas, such as beer bottles left near the children's playground. The letterforms are inspired by a failed skeleton leaf attempt, creating a distinctive, deteriorating, fractured look represented by the rough texture seen in the type. By combining calligraphic and modular forms, the typeface conveys a message of environmental and societal neglect using the organic, yet disfigured contours from the experiment. Serving as a poignant reminder of the beauty lost when spaces are mistreated.
