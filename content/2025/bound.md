‘Bound’ is a typeface largely inspired by the stained glass East Window in St. Giles Church, Camberwell. The 13th-century style window's design was heavily influenced by Chartres and various other mediaeval French cathedrals; the detailed imagery resembles a mosaic at a distance. Utilising segments of the window and transforming them into modular parts allowed me to create a typeface that resembles the key visual aspects of stained glass - the lines mimic the soldering, while the negative space mimics the glass, which directly references sections of the East Window. I was particularly inspired by this aspect of the church, as it has been rebuilt numerous times; the windows melted in the 1841 fire and shattered during WW2. The many reconstructions serve as a symbol of St. Giles Church's resilience in the face of the tragedies it has faced in its 1000-year-long history.
