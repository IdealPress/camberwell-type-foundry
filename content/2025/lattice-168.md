Lattice 168 is a modular typeface made up of structural elements of Peckham Library, taking properties of the bold geometric cladding with the juxtaposing thin, asymmetric columns. This typeface was created with a strict grid in mind, made within the constraint of rectangles that were influenced by the grid of 168 windows that expand over the rear of the library. So when typed out it keeps to a lattice pattern. The aim of Lattice 168 is to capture the striking unconventional character that Peckham Library has stood within surrounding urban areas.
