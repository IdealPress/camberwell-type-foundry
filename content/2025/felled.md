"Felled" is a typeface inspired by the natural textures of felled logs, with a distinct connection to Peckham Rye Park and Common. Its design shows and represents the organic and irregular patterns found in wood and the worn-down edges of trees- blending the rough earthy aesthetics with modern typographic forms. Each letter reflects the unique imperfections of nature, which gives the whole typeface a more authentic feel. "Felled" combines the features of the park with a functional design, making it suitable for projects that look to push the idea of the outdoors or sustainability.
