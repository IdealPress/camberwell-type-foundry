The 'Common Holly' typeface is inspired by Lucas Gardens, a welcoming green space in Peckham known for its diverse native and exotic plants. At its heart stands the Common Holly, a striking winter feature with deep green, spiked leaves and vibrant red berries. This contrast of sharpness and vibrancy shaped the typeface's design, incorporating organic, pointed details into each letterform. The result is a typeface that feels both wild and structured, reflecting the holly's resilience and beauty. 'Common Holly' is best suited for titles and display purposes rather than extended texts.
