Using a rounded font, using soft lines to contrast with the original straight structure of the station, while integrating the design elements of modern and retro subway stations, so that the font can radiate a unique charm in the fusion of old and new. This font can not only add visual interest but also allow the historical charm of the station to co-exist with the modern sense, creating a brand-new aesthetic experience.
