I made this typeface from the structure of the lighthouse building, I noticed there were many shapes on the outside of the building and decided to use the squares and rectangles. Some lines are also curved, I took this idea from an actual lighthouse and how it uses its round building to stay strong against forces in all directions. I applied this to my typefaces to show how the lighthouse has a strong community around it.
