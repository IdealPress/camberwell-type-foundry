Kink, inspired by the links of bike chains, captures the raw energy and precision of BMX. Each letter, formed by the interlocking links, mirrors the mechanical power and fluid motion of BMX riders pushing limits on ramps and streets. Just like a BMX bike, this font is built for speed, agility, and resilience, with every curve and edge reflecting the grind of the ride. The chains represent both the freedom of self-expression within sport and the discipline of control, making it a perfect reflection of the sport,  connected, and always in motion.
