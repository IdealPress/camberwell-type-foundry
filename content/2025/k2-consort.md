K2 Consort is a font designed from the window structure of the K2 cast iron Telephone Box, and it's location, Consort Road. Both qualities are captured within 2 modular parts, in three sizes, that form the architectural typeface. The double stroke lines resemble Giles Gilberts Scotts Telephone Box design in 1962, as well as the road it is situated on. Through a focus of oval counters, inspired by the roof design, it captures the obsolescence of the Telephone Box. K2 consort revives the design and character of the phone, since no longer being in use.
