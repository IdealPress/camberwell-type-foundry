Under the bridge is a typeface which visually narrates the history of the Old Grand Surrey Canal which relates to my research site, old canal bridge located in Burgess Park. Beginning with open, fluid letters that capture the canal's flowing water. The design of the typeface becomes more saturated as the alphabet progresses symbolising the canals filling and eventual disappearance. This typeface combines both history and design and serves as a reminder of the Canal and Burgess Park's transformation over the years and the layers of memory that it now embodies. It also serves as an answer to the question of why there is a bridge that leads to nowhere..
