The font Obscura is inspired by The South London Gallery in Peckham, Southwark and is based on something as simple as a painted over door. I wanted the letters to convey that something is concealed or withered away, also nodding to the building's common theme of closed off rooms.
Obscura could be difficult to read as a full body of text so it could be considered more a display font.
