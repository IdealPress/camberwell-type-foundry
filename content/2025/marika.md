Marika draws heavily from gothic traditions, its thick, commanding strokes are designed to envelop the page, capturing the weight and grandeur of ancient churches, its main inspiration deriving from the centuries old form of type, 'Black Letters'. The form of each character evokes the sense of carved stone, while the sharp angles and intricate details reflect the ornate nature of gothic design. This typeface in its boldness and heaviness, transforms the written word into something monumental. It's a design that dominates, leaving a lasting impression.
