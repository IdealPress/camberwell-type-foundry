Inspired by Burgess Park's new entrance gates, "Fold Line" echoes the structure's unique geometric patterns. The gates designed by LDA Design for the park's 2012 renovation, depict Burgess Park's previous layout - an industrial urban complex with streets, factories and a canal running through it - using steel lines to represent the grid of abandoned roads and lanes. "Fold Line" attempts to bring the flat map to life with letters creating a street view perspective, tying together the park's industrial heritage and its modern incarnation. Above are some of my previous experimental work based on the park's structures such as the Lime Kiln and The Bridge to Nowhere.
