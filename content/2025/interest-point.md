Interest Point is a font born from 20 dynamic anchor points that shift and twist on a vertical rectangle, each movement sculpting a letter, symbol, or punctuation mark with fluid precision. This striking design draws its inspiration from the Edwards Passmore Library and Bathhouse, with an irregular, almost rebellious floor plan which echoes in every curve of the font. The building itself is a fractured rectangle, its walls slanted and corners sharp, each turn a deliberate defiance of symmetry'much like the font that mirrors its architectural complexity. Yet, despite its jagged origin, each glyph in Interest Point is perfectly uniform, occupying the same precise width, creating a surprisingly geometric harmony. This contrast is where the true beauty lies, as the font's crisp, ordered structure stands in sharp juxtaposition to the building's timeworn elegance. The library, with its intricately carved stone and delicate details, speaks to a history long past, its weathered surfaces echoing the passage of time'just as Interest Point bridges the gap between the old and the new in its bold, geometric form.
