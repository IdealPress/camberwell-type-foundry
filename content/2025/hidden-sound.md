The typeface I designed was inspired by the hidden sounds in burgess Park. I use water to visualize sound. In particular, the ripples created by sound shaking water. Sound itself is invisible, but when it meets water, it can take on a unique dynamic form in a visual way. 
The strokes of this font are full of curves and hierarchical changes, as if each letter is a moment of water wave diffusion, both soft and powerful. Make it suitable for art design, but also for daily typesetting.
