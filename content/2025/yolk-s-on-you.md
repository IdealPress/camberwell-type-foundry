'Yolk's on You' is a playful yet meaningful typeface inspired by London's chicken shop culture. Its design is soft with no sharp corners, reflecting the natural form of a chicken's body, incorporating physical features like the beak, comb and eyes. This friendly and humorous aesthetic pays homage to the past while embracing a more modernized simplistic design, which communicates the gentrification wave reshaping Peckham.'Yolk's on You' balances nostalgia and reinvention, making it a versatile font that captures the spirit of a more hippy transformation, while celebrating the unique character of its cultural roots.
