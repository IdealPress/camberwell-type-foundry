Aspect is a display typeface inspired by the mass of the rye apartments and the contrast of the bold structure against sky. The design uses angled lines with sharp geometric features which illustrate different perspectives and point of views, intended to convey the impression that the viewer is looking up at the building due to its large scale. The stroke widths are wide and unbalanced to further create a sense of the three dimensional structure. The negative spaces and counters within the type face can be interpreted as windows and the sky, showcasing the architectural influence.
