'Wingspan' is a font inspired by the Pelican Estate in Peckham, drawing from the estate's architectural forms and community spirit. The serifs of the font take inspiration from the sharp, curved beak of a falcon, adding a playful and dynamic edge to the letterforms. This font is intended for use in the estate's playground, where its bold and engaging shapes can capture children's attention and encourage interaction (hence the childlike nature). By incorporating elements of nature and the estate's identity, the font creates a visually stimulating environment that enhances the playful atmosphere of the space.'
