My font inspiration and thoughts came from the fire station of Peckham Road. The idea of choosing this building came from my curiosity about the brick structure of the fire station, and I love the structural characteristics of this building. My main focus is on the structure of the building, especially the arrangement of the brick walls and the structural characteristics of the brick walls themselves. The main inspiration for the font frame was the gaps between the bricks in the brick wall, and the use of blank to express the combination of letters. Each letter is designed as a square or square shape. My typeface is mainly about the connection between building structure and modular design.
