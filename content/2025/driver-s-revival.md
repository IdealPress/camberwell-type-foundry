Driver's Revival is a font inspired by the elegance of Italianate architecture, while also capturing the modern curves and shapes of Denmark Hill's reconstructed structure. The concept behind this design is to connect the physical journeys travellers take through the station with the metaphorical journeys reflected in its architecture. After a fire led to reconstruction, Denmark Hill Station now features minimalist arches that contrast with the original brick arches decorated with iron cast embellishments. The indistinguised shadows from these arches weaves together the station's historical and contemporary elements, creating a visual journey.
