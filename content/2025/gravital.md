'Gravital' was inspired by the simplicity and brevity of Brutalist architecture that was beautifully portrayed in the example of Saint Michael's Church in Camberwell. Each letter is deeply connected to the church's architecture and structure in hopes of representing its nature and atmosphere. This typeface is meant to be heavy, sharp, minimalistic, and structural, combining all the various qualities of Brutalist buildings, as well as the classic condensed and bold fonts that it was inspired by, making it quite adaptable to different purposes but still unique and noticeable, just like Saint Michael's Church itself.
