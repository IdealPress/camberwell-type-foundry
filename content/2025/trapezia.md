Trapezia is a typeface based on the exterior of the Peckham Library, where 
I combined the thickness of the buildings main body with the slenderness of 
its supports to create a typeface with a variety of thicknesses. The surface 
of the building and the overall shape of the building is made up of trapezoidal 
shapes, so I used the trapezoidal shapes as a frame for each letter and let the 
letters themselves be made up of trapezoidal elements.Trapezia is a variation 
of Trapezoid, with ia as a suffix to give the typeface a modern feel.
