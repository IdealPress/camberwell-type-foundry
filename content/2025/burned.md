This typeface was influenced by the historical context of the St. Gile's church, the destruction it has gone through due to a fire that burned down the church completely in 1844, slowly chipping parts away from it. The missing pieces represent both the physical effect the fire has on things and the metaphorical showing how after such an event it is given that some parts will never be recovered. Even though the typeface is based on historical context, its main objective is to portray something missing and partially complete.
