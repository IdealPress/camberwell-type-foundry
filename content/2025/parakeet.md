Like a bird in flight, 'Parakeet' is a typeface designed to be dynamic and playful. Made up of angular swooping forms it reflects the motion of a flying parakeet, incorporating features such as the wingspan and tail feathers. Diagonal, sharp forms emulate a sense of freedom and movement whilst embracing a more clean, practical design through its uniformity. This contrast highlights the way Peckham has become more gentrified in the last few decades. The symbolism of the parakeets emulates a sense of resilience in displacement, as they continue to thrive despite not being native to London or the UK.
