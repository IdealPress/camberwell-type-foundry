Grove is a typeface inspired by the Queen Anne Revival style of architecture seen at the Grove House Tavern. Combining elements from transitional humanist typefaces like Baskerville with modern ideas from typefaces like Didot, Grove establishes itself as an example of the fundamental contrasts between new and old, and between ornamental and structural. Grove is flexible in its application, although it is best used at a high point size.
