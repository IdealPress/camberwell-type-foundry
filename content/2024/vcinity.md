Inspired by the wild, dynamic collages of unintended collaboration scattered in the vinicity of the Peckham Rye station building.

Created as a homage to the vibrant displays of vandalism meeting function, to reveal the abstract art of everyday life presenting itself as layers of posters, flyers and graffiti.
