It represents the aspect of the South London Gallery as a place that would certainly keep on hovering between two points: the past and the future, where it continues to change and reimagine itself from time to time but is still able to preserve its beginningsâ€”almost perfectly. I want the typeface to be able to represent this breaking point, and how it is expanding away from the fonts we normally observe on street signs, on directory signs, but not too much that all the traces from those are completely lost.
