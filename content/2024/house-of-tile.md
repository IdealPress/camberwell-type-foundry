The House of Tile typeface is influenced by the geometry that builds the pubs grand nature. Taking inspiration from the Art Deco movement that influenced A.E. Sewells architecture for the building, I created a pixelated typeface with exaggerated serifs and tails to reflect the eraâ€™s extravagance.

This typeface, while working on a limited 11 x 9 square grid, had a lot of curvature and character. Due to the less squares on diagonals and more weight on one side of the letters, I created a consistent look across my whole type
