It is designed based on the bricks used to build the church. Each brick was stacked together, sorted, and then flattened to form an English letter. I named this font “Brick” because the font is made of appearance of the bricks. In my opinion, this style of church looks a lot like a mysterious old castle. I also tried a lot of colors, the most common being black and white. As for monochrome, I currently think black has a better visual effect. The overall effect not only enhances the appearance of bricks, but the main black color also looks sample, but also has a modern feel. I used AI to remove the texture of the brick and added some textures based on the font design to make it look like bricks, so I came up with my font design.
