My typeface is based on the South London Gallery in Peckham, Southwark. I decided to create an ornamental typeface, also known as a display font. By designing a display font, I was able to add identifying characteristics without worrying about legibility. This is because the font is not intended for use in the body of text but rather for titles and headings, where the purpose is to grab the reader's attention instantly. My typeface is primarily based on the iron railings located at the gallery's entrance but also from a wooden floor panel by Walter Crane featured inside the building.
