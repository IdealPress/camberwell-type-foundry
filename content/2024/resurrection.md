The Bussey Building has a long history; it was a derelict building before acting as the creative center of Peckham nowadays. The Resurrection typeface tried to capture the contrast between the visual elements of the building and its new purpose. Bricks and pipes are the main elements of the building, and they have existed since the building was built. In the typeface, they are layered irregularly, which shows the concept of the creative center by altering the "old elements" in a new way, like how the local social group Peckham Vision saved the building and gave it a new life and purpose.
