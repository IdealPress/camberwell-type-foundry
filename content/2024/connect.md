This concept was centered on the dial buttons' shapes; the dials were utilized in the design almost like a grid system. The joint buttons were supposed to reflect the dialing flow, so I thought it would be great to incorporate the way they move as you push them. The name "connect" was carefully chosen to encapsulate the purpose and essence of the phone box. It is a simple yet powerful word that succinctly captures the act of bringing people together, no matter the distance between them. This name serves as a constant reminder of the core function of the phone box â€“ to facilitate connections and enable communication between individuals.
