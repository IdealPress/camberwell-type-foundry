The inspiration for this font comes from Our Lady of Sorrows. The aim is to convey the splendid and solemn feeling that a church brings to people. The stained glass of the church is the main part that used to combine with the lowercase letters, while the uppercase letters capture the overall appearance of the church. Many churches are closely associated with Gothic architecture, but the designer of this church, Edward Pugin, attempted to blend Gothic with modern design, creating a novel elevation. This inspired me to merge church patterns with basic typography, finally the font ‘arabesquitic’ completed.
