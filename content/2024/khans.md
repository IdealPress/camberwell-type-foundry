Khan’s Deco Tiles is inspired by the Peckham based local emporium Khan’s Bargain. In the 19th Century the shop premises that is recognised as Khan’s Bargain was instead an established department store known as Holdron’s. In 1935 the owner of Holdron’s commissioned the architects T.P. Bennett and Sons to design Art Deco inspired interior and exterior. The bold rhombus shape which constructs the matrix style typeface is based on the original Art Deco tiles. When removing both the space and kerning between the letters the typeface forms the appearance of the unpreserved Art Deco tile flooring in Khan’s Bargain.
