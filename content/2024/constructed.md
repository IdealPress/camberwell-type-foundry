This font is inspired by the shapes on the facade of the South London Gallery Fire Station, specifically the three forms on the top of the building. Since the gallery was previously a fire station I wanted to work with the idea of transformation. Therefore, I started out with a plain square and used shapes from the building to chip away at the block and create letters that mimic the building, essentially stripping away what was there before and transforming it into something new like transforming a fire station into an art gallery. I wanted to construct something simple yet eye catching and powerful.
