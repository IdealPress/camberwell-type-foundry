FLAME is inspired by the South London Gallery Fire Station, a Victorian-style fire station turned contemporary art gallery. The multi-functionality and transitional journey of the building is what inspired me to base my typeface on this building. FLAME is an amalgamation of traditional Victorian typefaces with a contemporary twist in the form of flame-like forms within the typeface. I wanted my typeface to reflect the buildingâ€™s ability to preserve its historical elements whilst staying relevant through time. FLAME is adaptable and can be used in any way or form due to it having traditional yet experimental characteristics.
