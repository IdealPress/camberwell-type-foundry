Reflex is a typeface based on the design of the Peckham Library. Peckham Library is a miss; it's a large elevated building with a colorful and reflective exterior. My type of design aims to capture the vibrant and reflective exterior of the building and simultaneously tries to imitate the unusual forms in the library's interior. The ultimate purpose of the typeface is to be interactive and engaging with its audience.
