Inspired by Nunhead Cemetery, “All Saints” began in a place that largely symbolises endings. Nunhead is likely the least known, though widely considered the most beautiful, of The Magnificent Seven which is a series of Victorian Gothic garden cemeteries along the outskirts of London and was originally called All Saints Cemetery. As I explored Nunhead on my several visits to the place, I found myself repeatedly drawn to the architecture of the chapel that sits just within the north gates. It struck me as the guardian of the cemetery, as the moment you step through the entrance you’re greeted by its looming shape at the end of the gravel avenue ahead of you. Inspired by this, I utilised several different visual elements of Nunhead Cemetery’s chapel’s facade in the letterforms of the typeface.
