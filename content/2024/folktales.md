The pub is a place for people to gather and tell stories. FOLKTALES font celebrates that, highlighting ornate traditional pub aesthetics and linking them to the illuminated calligraphic manuscripts of old. Playful but somewhat aggressive and angular with an undeniable dark and eerie side like a Grimm’s fairytale. The Kentish Drovers is a 21st century chain pub operating out of a converted bank that references several Old English aesthetics, reflected in this type’s traditional yet unspecific look. A typeface with a sense of humour, suitable for grandiosely illustrating the somewhat imaginary tales you might hear on a night out down the pub.
