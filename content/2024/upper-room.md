UpperRoom is a typeface inspired by the South London Gallery Fire Station. The building was originally designed to house the firefighters and their families on the top floors, and to store the equipment on the bottom floor. This typeface artfully captures the juxtaposition of the laborious lower level and the tranquil upper floors. Beyond its typographic significance, UpperRoom serves as a personal homage to the building. The safety and warmth of a family bond paired with the passionate spirit of the fire. This typeface captures the feeling of Living in the UpperRoom.
