The ‘George Bussey Family’ typeface interrogates the rich history of the Bussey Building in Peckham, paying particular attention to the life and works of the great Victorian manufacturer George Bussey. The main typeface consists of soft, block-like letterforms informed by the shape of the windows on the ground floor of the old factory building. Using this grid as a body shape for each character has generated a consistent style of lettering with fine counters and apertures that juxtapose the thick stems of the letters. The typeface also contains various alternate characters, each depicting some of Bussey’s most notable products, celebrating craftsmanship and creativity, which remain at the core of the redeveloped Copeland Park today.
