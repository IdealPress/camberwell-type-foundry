Derived from Victorian tile art within the South London Gallery, my typeface transforms patterns into sleek, contemporary geometric shapes. The concept revolves around a deliberate clash of historical architecture with a modern twist. Constructed through modular design principles, each letter blends various geometric forms. The result is a typeface that harmoniously bridges ancient and contemporary elements. Specifically embodying the gallery’s modern facet, New Modary represents its contemporary exhibitions and modern culture, the typeface becomes a dynamic expression of the gallery’s vibrant and evolving identity.
