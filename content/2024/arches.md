My font has been inspired by the revival of gothic architecture in London during the 19th century, specifically; Our Lady of Sorrows, Queens Road Peckham. I have aimed to create a typeface that conveys attributes found in gothic-style catholic churches. The foundation of my design was constructed through the narrow pointed arches positioned on either side of the church that separate the side aisles from the centre. I intend on my typeface being perceived as a modern response to neo-gothic architecture that could perhaps be used in magazine or album covers.
