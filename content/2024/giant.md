The shape of the Old Canal Bridge inspires this font called Giant. This rebuilt bridge is no longer a transportation structure connecting different places, but a heritage sculpture with more than a hundred years of history standing across the Canal. Since it lost its traffic significance, it resembles a trapezium architecture. It has solid foundations on both sides and a flat footpath in the middle, lifting people firmly like a giant. Its presence throughout the park cannot be ignored, serving as a prominent landmark that reminds people of its history of spanning wars.
