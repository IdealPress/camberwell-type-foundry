Glee is an abstract typeface inspired by the present-day studios of the Bussey Building that would be characterized by a fusion of eclectic elements, shapes, and a sense of creative spontaneity. The goal was to capture the artistic essence and evoke a feeling of whimsy. I designed my letterforms to look like organic shapes to mimic the imperfections often found in handmade art and reflect the diverse community of Peckham. The typeface incorporates playful proportions, stylized curves and contrasting counter forms creating a visually engaging rhythm throughout. This variability adds a touch of uniqueness to each character. The typeface is versatile enough for various design applications. It conveys a sense of expressiveness that allows it to be used in a range of contexts, from posters and packaging to digital designs.
