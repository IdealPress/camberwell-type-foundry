Victorian Bloom is a typeface I designed after researching the background of Walworth Garden. After the Victorian homes were demolished, community activists transformed the land into a community garden. I was struck by the contrast between the area now covered in nature and the area once occupied by Victorian homes, so I decided to design a typeface based on the history of the garden. The typeface echoes the architectural roots of the land, embodying details of the Victorian era. Additionally, it incorporates a floral design with blooms emerging from it, enabling it to capture the evolution in the garden's progression from its past to its present state.
