Intersection is a detailed display typeface created with shapes and silhouettes taken from the Bussey Building in Copeland Park Industrial Estate. Copeland park could be considered as an intersection between Peckham High Street and quieter residential areas, connecting parts of the community with small business, restaurants and social spaces. Intersection is best used with a larger pt or as a display typeface as some of the smaller details would be lost in smaller sizes.
