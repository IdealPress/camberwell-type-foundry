A font inspired by the bakers process:‘Bakers Dozen’ explores the question; “what makes a space, a space?” and more importantly, “What makes a bakery, a bakery?”. The baked goods you find inside, are what solidify the space. Inspired by South-Londons’ ‘Toad Bakery’, I wanted my typeface to highlight the importance of what happens behind the scenes in bakeries. Watching and learning from the processes that can be seen at Toad, I took inspiration and followed similar processes to create my letters. Working with pastry, I individually shaped and baked each letter, just as a baker would shape each of their pastries.
