The Simone 65 typeface draws inspiration from Peckhamplex, an old Sainsbury's repurposed into a movie theatre in 1994 while maintaining its distinctive architecture.

The focal point of my typeface is the art deco-style pilasters on the building facade, which introduce a geometric form to my design, constructed from modular shapes. By seamlessly integrating the physical presence of the building into the typeface design, I tried to capture the unique character and evolving history of Peckhamplex. This design approach creates a visual language that combines the site's narrative and embodiment, offering a representation of its journey.
