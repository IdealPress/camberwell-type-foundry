"Come into view" was inspired by the intricate details the Peckhamplex building has acquired over time. Exploring both the building's interior and exterior spaces at different times of the day allowed many different details to present themselves, particularly those that included the projection of light. Playing with a particular shape that these shadows exposed, I was left with a series of angular letters of contrasting thicknesses. "Come Into View" works best when used for displaying text, particularly magnified. It is only when these letters are put together do they become legible, exposing the user's intent.
