Cheeky Mayo is a unique typeface created from mayonnaise, it was inspired by the lively atmosphere of High Street Peckham's Burger King. Influenced by the playful magnetism of the iconic logo, the font aims to capture the essence of what happens inside the restaurant. My goal was to design something that not only reflects the building's appearance but also embodies the spirit of Burger King. With Cheeky Mayo, I wanted to convey the distinct experience of working in fast food, capturing the energetic and lively character that is equivalent with the brand.
