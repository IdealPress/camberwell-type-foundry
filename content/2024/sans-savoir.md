Sans-Savoir is a simplistic typeface. It has been created using lines with small breaks in between. The concept behind this font came from the fact that the site was temporarily closed, limiting the amount of information I could access. This created the concept of having missing information, being the missing gaps within the font. The name Sans-Savoir means without-knowing, referring to the lack of knowledge. People tend to fill in the gaps when information is missing, much like when you look at the font, you can still read the letters because you're brain fills in those missing pieces.
