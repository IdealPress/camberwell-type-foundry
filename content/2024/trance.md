Trance is a typeface inspired by Copeland park, character wise it contrasts two opposing ideas: structure and flow. Structure coming from its background being used as a transportation hub and flow representing all the businesses and events that reside there. The beauty of my typeface is that no two characters are the same corresponding to each business that resides there. Seeing Copeland Park from a human perspective allowed me to connect with the building beneath what lies under the surface. I felt overwhelmed, this emotion is also something I chose to allow the observer to feel through just the eyes.
