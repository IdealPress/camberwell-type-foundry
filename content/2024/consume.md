‘Consume’ is about the destruction and consumption of space in a place as historically and culturally significant as Peckham. I wanted to show this literally, with the characters being consumed by space. ‘Consume’ is not meant to be used as small text, as it is very difficult to read in a dense format. It needs to be in a larger format, in which it takes up space and cannot be ignored. There is irony in the way I created a font that challenges the idea of capitalism and the consumption of space but needs to appeal to both of those things to work and be used successfully.
