Introducing ‘Luminatrix Sans’, a matrix type I designed while being inspired by the Peckhamplex building in Peckham Rye Lane. As Peckhamplex is an independent establishment of cheap and simple entertainment for the public, I wanted to capture this idea of simplicity and enjoyment. While Luminatrix Sans looks quite modern due to the use of a matrix grid, it also hearkens back to the 1980s feel the establishment has since it also hearkens back to the halogen lightbulbs that lit up the marquee signs of cinemas back in the 80s. Using circles to fill up the 14x14 matrix grid, this display font is best suited for digital displays, poster designs, and commercial marketing.
