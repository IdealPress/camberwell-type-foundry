‘Glue depot’ is a sans serif typeface that was created initially from hot glue, beginning as a physical stick, then heated and becoming liquid to finally ending as a letter that can be held and bended. This reflects the ways that my site, Camberwell bus garage, has always adapted to its ever-changing environment. The glue also symbolises the way London relies so heavily on public transport making it, in a way, the ‘glue’ of society. The final useable typeface is in a simplified version, allowing it be more versatile as well as increasing readability.
