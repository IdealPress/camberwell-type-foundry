My font design is based on the Kentish Drovers architecture. the Kentish Drovers looks ordinary, but it has a long history and attracts many tourists from all over the world, and now the Kentish Drovers is a bar. The whole font I designed is composed of lines and rectangles, because the architectural appearance of the building from the earliest days to the present is composed of lines and squares, so I grasped this point, and then designed this set of fonts.
