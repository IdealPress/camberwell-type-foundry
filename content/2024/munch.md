This font draws inspiration from the burger king building on Peckham High Street. Its bubbly design mimics a burger bun, closely resembling burger king's existing font. Notably, each letter, number, and symbol features a distinct touch â€“ a bite missing, adding a playful and distinctive element to the overall aesthetic. Every letter is different with a uniquely placed missing bite. the colour palette and use of a 3d effect also aim to resemble the aesthetics of a burger bun. This new approach honours the famous fast-food chain by creating a unique typeface that visually captures the essence of Burger King.
