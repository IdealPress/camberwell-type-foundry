The font Montage was inspired by the collage-like model of the Old Canal Bridge. Bricks and rocks combined with metal formed the industrial-like structure it is now. Named after the technique, montage uses collage methods and is made physically with paper. The combination of red and black in the font is not just a presentation to the appearance of the bridge but can also be seen as 'patches' given to the bridge over the 100 years to preserve its existence and meanings. After years of deconstruction and reconstruction, the canal was filled. From then on, the bridge wasnâ€™t rebuilt for the purpose of crossing but was seen as an industrial heritage and a link between the old and new. Today, the bridge still stands in the same place with stories from the past and is made into the new structure.
