The sans serif typeface Tarnished seeks to capture the disrepair and degradation of Peckham Palace that has occurred over the last few decades. Tarnished completely integrated the location within its designs by utilising textures from all around Peckham Palais including its surface and details collected through a series of pencil etching and photography. which were then collected and assembled into typeface. Due to this process certain aspects were intangible so to ensure readability and improve its relation to the site certain parts were altered and simplified.
