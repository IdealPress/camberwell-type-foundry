‘Spinose’ is born from the extreme magnification of the humble nettle. Each letter takes form from the organic, fluid nature of the nettle, which adorn the grounds of The Nunhead Cemetery. Bold spines embellish each hand drawn letter in an aggressive armor. This brazen typeface is playful and commands the attention of its audience, hence my intended use would be as a display font.

Preferably within the extreme winter sports industry. I could envision my typeface being used on the underside of a snowboard for an eye-catching, memorable glimpse as it is ridden down the mountain.
