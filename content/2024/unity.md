Unity is a typeface inspired by the rope used as a necklace from the medallions of the Catholic Church. After looking into St Giles Church, Catholic churches have the aspect of the traditional altar servers. I created a brush that I can use to draw the spines of the alphabet, numbers and special characters. The design of the brush is supposed to represent the ‘unity’ that is shown by the people of the Catholic religion and their belief in it.
