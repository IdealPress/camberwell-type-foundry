        <p>Welcome to the Camberwell College of Arts Type Foundry. This website hosts fonts designed by BA (Hons) Graphic Design students, created during their first year of study on the course.</p>
        <p>The project asks students to design type in response to building or site in London. After taking part in workshops exploring the history and traditions of type design, the students conduct independent primary and contextual research to help develop their ideas into digital type files.</p>
        <p>You can read about each project in more detail by selecting an individual project page, test out the fonts using the type tester, or download .OTF or .TTF files for personal use.</p>
